    "Neural Networks haven't seemed to be very popular for regression compared to more classcial machine learning methods. Interested as to why this maybe the case We set out to explore the diffrences between these classical machine learning techinques and neural networks when it comes to regression. To do this we will look at housing price prediction in India from the India Home Dataset found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/housing-prices-in-metropolitan-areas-of-india. The data represents the price of the home, the area of the home, and about the presecne of 40 diffrent kind of ammienties in the surrounding area. Towards predicting the price of the home and comparing the approches for classical and neural net based machine learning, we devided the work into two sections: classical machine learning and neural network development. For the classical machine learning, we used hyperparameter tuning via train, test, validation spilts to identify the best parameters for XX diffrent classical algorithms, then experimented with creating diffrent ensembles from each of those models to get an ideal classical machine learning algorithm for predicting home prices on this dataset. For the neueral network side, we created a variety of fairly shallow models to try and optimize *MSELoss and DO WE ADD ANOTHER LOSS HERE* and tested each on validation data to see what created the lowest loss with the simpliest model to explain the data. After trying these two approches, we compared the results of these two algorithms via $MSE$ and $R^2$ to better understand what these two approches can accomplish on thier own. We found that classical machine learning approches had larger $R^2$ but worse $MSE$ than neueral networks (ADD SPEFFIFC NUMBERS) implying that classical machine learning for regression is far more explainable than neueral networks. \n"

    "Among other metrics, house prices are oftentimes considered in evaluating the economic performance of a particular country. On a macro and micro level, housing prices can have significant consequences–ranging from an individual deciding to purchase their first home to evaluating a country’s Gross Domestic Product<a name=\"Congressional\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#Congressionalnote). Thus, given this importance, some study has been done into home price prediction.\n",
    "This importance has led to many attempts to predict house prices by researchers dating back to the 1990s.  The article, Predicting House Prices Using Multiple Listings Data, writes about the importance of accurately predicting house prices for its importance in administering mortgages and home owner insurance <a name=\"Dubin\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#Dubinnote) . To do so, the author discusses using three algorithms: Ordinary Least Squares, Maximum likelihood, and kriging. Noting that geographical location is a difficult variable to take into account using ordinary linear regression, the author delves into each algorithm and how it is implemented, considering what model is appropriate for each scenario; in particular, the author notes that the maximum likelihood function is useful for variables which are difficult to account for. The purpose behind this is to use the correlations between the prices of nearby homes to get a more accurate estimate of a given home’s price in a more effective method given the difficulties with OLS and geography. The article then discusses a practical example from listing with Baltimore, comparing the various techniques explored in the article. In particular, the article uses grid search to maximize the parameters of the likelihood function to provide the best prediction. While the $R^2$ score for the algorithms was around $0.7$, the author did see significant improvements (as much as 65.3% improvement) using methods to determine relative housing price from nearby houses over traditional OLS. A table of values comparing the estimation sample from the prediction samples show that the estimations are fairly accurate. However, given the age of the article, it would be interesting to see if such techniques still hold up today in the world of deep networks. \n",
    "Recent research attempts to use a generalized Linear Regression in conjunction with other statistical measures as a baseline model to predict housing prices. This is done to improve the accuracy of models that attempt to predict housing price with the importance housing prices have for both a consumer and supplier as each considers the risks involved in purchasing real estate<a name=\"li\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#Linote) . In particular, the article considers controlling investment in real estate as it has historically caused long-term economic issues citing this as a motivating factor for accurately predicting housing prices. The article delves into a detailed explanation of how their model is trained and all the different parameters it considers. Although the accuracy of the model is not stated, it seems that this group use of nonparametric parameters has led to a more accurate model compared to previous models.\n",
    "With respect to the dataset we are currently using, a handful of kaggle users have made attempts to predict house price given the dataset already, with limited success. There have been 15 notebooks made with a handful using ML with varying degrees of quality and accuracy. One of the more completed notebooks is<a name=\"Masghiff\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#Masghiffnote) . This notebook looked at 5 different models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Ridge CV, and ElasticNetCV) with onehot encoding and scaling transformations. There was no cross validation, model selection or hyper parameter tuning. The best scoring model  was random forests with a R^2 of 0.72 and an MSE of.0.27. Our work will focus much more on model improvements (and greater dataset expansion if possible) as a result to differentiate between us and previous work. \n"

Include the detailed code and analysis results of those points only; you should spend more time/code/plots on your main point than the others.\n",

If its slightly relevant to the narrative or you just want us to know you tried something, you could keep it in by summarizing the result in this report in a sentence or two, moving the actual analysis to another file in your repo, and providing us a link to that file.\n",

Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.\n",

    "Are there any problems with the work?  For instance would more data change the nature of the problem? Would it be good to explore more hyperparams than you had time for?   \n",

    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "If your project has obvious potential concerns with ethics or data privacy discuss that here.  Almost every ML project put into production can have ethical implications if you use your imagination. Use your imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you can't come up with an obvious ethical concern that should be addressed, you should know that a large number of ML projects that go into producation have unintended consequences and ethical problems once in production. How will your team address these issues?\n",

    "Consider a tool to help you address the potential issues such as https://deon.drivendata.org\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Reiterate your main point and in just a few sentences tell us how your results support it. Mention how this work would fit in the background/context of other work in this field if you can. Suggest directions for future work if you want to."
